Q: What difference between a class and an object?

            Journal.cs    Entry.cs
- Class          1           1 
- Object         1           3

A: A class is a blueprint or a template that defines the properties and methods of an object. 
   So,  there is only one class, but multiple objects can be created from that class. 

## To create a Class Constructor,  use the following syntax:
 
public Bin(string demonination, float value, int quantity);
Ex.  public Bin = new("quarters", (float)0.25, 40)  // Using (float)0.25 makes 0.25 from  a double to a float .
